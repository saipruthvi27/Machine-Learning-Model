# Machine-Learning-Model

#### About the dataset used to build the model
Apprentice Chef was created for busy professionals with little or no experience in the kitchen. They provide a large assortment of freshly prepared gourmet meals that are delivered to the customer on a regular basis. For the past three years, Apprentice Chef has been feeding busy consumers all across the San Francisco Bay Area. The executives wanted to recognize how much revenue to expect from each customer within their first year of orders. Halfway There, a cross-selling offer in which customers receive a half bottle of wine from a local California vineyard every Wednesday, was created to diversify their revenue stream. The company is curious as to which customers will sign up for this service.

####  The machine learning model is divided into three parts
- Regression Analysis
- Classification Analysis
- Analysis Report

####  Regression Analysis
This analysis consists of feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

The model types used:
- OLS Regression (standard linear regression)
- Lasso Regression
- Bayesian Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD)
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)

#### Classification Analysis
This analysis consists of bulding a predictive model on a binomial response variable(Y-variable) using the information retrieved from the regression analysis script.

The model types used to build the model:
- Logistic Regression
- Lasso Regression (Classification)
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (KNN)
- Classification Trees
- Random Forest (Classification)
- Gradient Boosted Models (GBM)

#### Analysis Report
Developed a consolidated report to submit to the management containing top actionable insights from the case as well as from the final revenue and cross-sell promotion models.

Kindly go through all the documents for a much more detailed and scripted analysis.
