# Machine-Learning-Model

#### About the dataset used to build the model
Apprentice Chef was created for busy professionals with little or no experience in the kitchen. They provide a large assortment of freshly prepared gourmet meals that are delivered to the customer on a regular basis. For the past three years, Apprentice Chef has been feeding busy consumers all across the San Francisco Bay Area. The executives wanted to recognize how much revenue to expect from each customer within their first year of orders. Halfway There, a cross-selling offer in which customers receive a half bottle of wine from a local California vineyard every Wednesday, was created to diversify their revenue stream. The company is curious as to which customers will sign up for this service.
